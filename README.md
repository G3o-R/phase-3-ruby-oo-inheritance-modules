# Modules

## Learning Goals

- Use modules to share functionality across classes

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we discussed the concept of inheritance. We learned that
through **subclasses** (a certain class under a **super class**), the subclass
has access to all of the methods of its parent class. Inheriting one class from
another makes sense. The subclass can be understood as a child or subordinate of
the super class. For example, a car is a type of vehicle, so it makes sense for
the `Car` class to _inherit_ from the `Vehicle` class.

Let's think about a slightly different type of example, one that is less
hierarchical. We could easily envision writing an app that models the
environment of a dance performance. Such an app might have a `Dancer` class.
Dancers, we know, perform dances. Similarly, we could imagine a little kid
going to see the Nutcracker ballet one Christmas, coming home and wanting to
practice all of the ballet moves from the show. So, we might write a `Kid` class
in which an instance of that class, our little kid who has gone to see the
ballet, should have access to all those ballet moves (their performance skill
notwithstanding).

This situation is not hierarchical, like our `Car` and `Vehicle` example.
Instead, `Kid` and `Dancer` simply need to share some functionality, without
being related in any other meaningful way.

This is where **modules** come in. Modules allow us to collect and bundle a
group of methods and make those methods available to any number of classes. In
this exercise, we'll be defining a `Dance` module and making it available to
both the `Dancer` and `Kid` class.

## Code Along 1: Including Module Methods as Instance Methods

Fork and clone this repo, and follow along with the walk-through below to get
your code working. Get the tests to pass.

### Step 1: Defining Our Module

We'll code our `Dance` module inside the `lib/dance_module.rb` file. Open up
that file and define your module with the following code:

```ruby
module Dance
end
```

Let's give our `Dance` module some fabulous moves:

```ruby
module Dance
  def twirl
    "I'm twirling!"
  end

  def jump
    "Look how high I'm jumping!"
  end

  def pirouette
    "I'm doing a pirouette"
  end

  def take_a_bow
    "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."
  end
end
```

Okay, now we'll define our `Kid` class and tell it to _include_ the capabilities
of the `Dance` module.

### Step 2: Defining the Classes

Open up `lib/kid.rb` and define your `Kid` class:

```ruby
class Kid
end
```

Let's do the same for the `Dancer` class in `lib/dancer.rb`:

```ruby
class Dancer
end
```

Now we're ready to include our module in our classes:

### Step 3: Including the Module

To lend our two classes all of the methods of the `Dance` module, we use the
`include` keyword:

```ruby
class Kid
  include Dance

  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

```ruby
class Dancer
  include Dance

  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

If we use the `include` keyword, we allow our classes to use all of the methods
of the included module as _instance_ methods. We'll talk about how to lend a
module's methods as _class_ methods in a minute.

Now that we've included the module, open up `bin/dance_party` and get familiar
with following code:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require_relative "../lib/kid.rb"
require_relative "../lib/dancer.rb"

angelina = Kid.new("Angelina")
mikhail_baryshnikov = Dancer.new("Mikhail")

puts "#{angelina.name} says: #{angelina.twirl}"
puts "#{mikhail_baryshnikov.name} says: #{mikhail_baryshnikov.take_a_bow}"
```

Now, run the file by typing `ruby bin/dance_party` and you should see the
following output in your terminal:

```txt
Angelina says: I'm twirling!
Mikhail says: Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all.
```

As you can see, we were able to **include** the `#twirl` instance method with
our `Kid` instance, and the `#take_a_bow` method with our `Dancer` instance,
even though those methods weren't defined directly in the classes! This is the
benefit of using modules: we can share behavior between multiple classes without
relying on inheritance.

## Code Along 2: Extending Module Methods as Class Methods

In order to lend a module's methods to a class as _class methods_, we use the
`extend` keyword. Let's write yet another module that we can extend into our
classes as class methods. For the purposes of this example, let's create a
shareable class method, `metadata`, which will report on some pertinent (shared)
information regarding both classes.

Open up the `lib/meta_dancing_module.rb` and define the following module and
methods:

```ruby
module MetaDancing

  def metadata
    "This class produces objects that love to dance."
  end
end
```

Let's `extend` this module into both the `Kid` and `Dancer` classes:

```ruby
class Dancer
  extend MetaDancing
end
```

```ruby
class Kid
  extend MetaDancing
end
```

Now, open up the bin/extending file and familiarize yourself with the following
code:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require_relative "../lib/kid"
require_relative "../lib/dancer"

puts Kid.metadata
puts Dancer.metadata
```

Run the file with `ruby bin/extending` and you should see the following output
in your terminal:

```txt
This class produces objects that love to dance.
This class produces objects that love to dance.
```

Run the tests to make sure some of your tests are passing.

**Note:** Run the `learn test` command at this point, and you will pass *almost* all of the tests! 

## Code Along 3: Namespacing Modules

In the first code along, we built a module called `Dance`, which contained
methods that we intended to be used as instance methods in the `Dancer` class.

In the second code along, we built the module `MetaDancing`, whose methods were
intended to be used as class methods in the `Kid` and `Dancer` classes.

There are two drawbacks to this approach. First, if another developer looks at
your modules, there is absolutely no way to determine how those methods are
intended to be used. Are they class methods? Are they instance methods? Nobody
knows!

Secondly, we had to build two separate modules that contained methods that were
all related to the same functionality (dancing). But because there was no way to
designate class methods versus instance methods, we were forced to define two
separate modules, which violates the single responsibility principle. Wouldn't
it be great if there was a way to define one module and specify which methods
were intended as class methods and which methods as instance methods.

Guess what? There is! We're going to refactor the two modules into one, and use
**module namespacing** to clarify how our code should be used. Let's update the
code in `lib/fancy_dance.rb` as follows:

```ruby
module FancyDance
  module InstanceMethods

    def twirl
      "I'm twirling!"
    end

    def jump
      "Look how high I'm jumping!"
    end

    def pirouette
      "I'm doing a pirouette"
    end

    def take_a_bow
      "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."
    end
  end

  module ClassMethods

    def metadata
      "This class produces objects that love to dance."
    end
  end
end

```

First, we define our `FancyDance` module. Then, inside the `FancyDance` module,
we define a second module, `InstanceMethods`. Inside the `InstanceMethods`
module, we place all our methods that we intend to be used as instance methods
(`twirl`, `jump`, `pirouette`, `take_a_bow`). Next, we define a second nested
module (nested inside of `FancyDance`) called `ClassMethods`. Inside, we place
the `metadata` method, which we intend to be used as a class method.

So how do we use these nested modules?

```ruby
class Dancer
  extend FancyDance::ClassMethods
  include FancyDance::InstanceMethods
end
```

```ruby
class Kid
  extend FancyDance::ClassMethods
  include FancyDance::InstanceMethods
end
```

**Note**: remember to require the `fancy_dance.rb` file inside the `dancer.rb`
and `kid.rb`, just like we did with our other file requirements.

We refer to the namespaced modules or classes with the `::` operator. This
syntax references the parent and child relationship of the nested modules.

Remember, `include` is used to add functionality to our classes via instance
methods. The `InstanceMethods` module inside the `FancyDance` module contains
the methods `twirl`, `jump`, `pirouette`, and `take_a_bow`, which any instance
of the `Dancer` or `Kid` class can do.

We can call:

```ruby
angelina = Dancer.new
angelina.twirl
# => "I'm twirling!"
angelina.jump
# => "Look how high I'm jumping!"

buster = Kid.new
buster.jump
# => "Look how high I'm jumping!"
buster.take_a_bow
# => "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."

```

Because we _included_ the `FancyDance::InstanceMethods` nested module, we can
call those instance methods on instances of our classes.

And `extend` is used to add functionality to our classes via class methods. We
can now call the `metadata` class method on the `Dancer` and `Kid` classes:

```ruby
Dancer.metadata
# => "This class produces objects that love to dance."
Kid.metadata
# => "This class produces objects that love to dance."
```

## Namespacing Class Definitions

The same module namespacing syntax we used above can also be used to namespace classes. You'll encounter syntax like this when working with other
Ruby libraries:

```rb
module ActiveRecord
  class Base
    # migration class definition
  end

  class Migration
    # migration class definition
  end
end
```

The reason for this namespacing is to avoid variable collision: what if our
application also happened to have a class definition for `Base` or `Migration`?
Thanks to namespacing, we can tell that these class definitions are specific to
the `ActiveRecord` module.

To use those class definitions, we refer to them using the `::` syntax:

```rb
ActiveRecord::Base
```

## Namespacing vs Inheritance

Inheritance using the `<` syntax implies that a class is a _type_ of another
class. A `BMW` class should inherit from a `Car` class because a BMW is a _type_
of car: `class BMW < Car`.

But what about the `::` that we're using for our modules? The `::` syntax just
denotes a namespace. Doing `BMW::Car` just gives the `BMW` class access to all
constants, instance methods, etc, without stating that a BMW is a type of car.
The `::` syntax carries all public items over to the inheriting class or module.

That's it! Now that we are familiar with several methods of sharing code between
classes, you're ready to move on to the next few labs.

## Conclusion

If you have a module whose methods you would like to be used in another class as
**instance methods**, then you must **include** the module.

If you want a module's methods to be used in another class as **class methods**,
you must **extend** the module.
